<h1 align="center">The Cheese and Wine Boutique</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://the-cheese-and-wine-boutique.herokuapp.com/)

<br>
The purpose of this project is to build an e-commerce site for the fictional cheese and wine business of the "Wilsons".

They import exclusive cheese and wines from all over the world and need an online outlet which displays their wares and provides     
a secure means for customers to buy them.

One of their selling points is that they offer cheese and wine deals of a selected wine and cheese package sold together for a discounted price.    
This is to encourage customers to try new products.

They also want to be able to offer a newsletter telling their customers all about the latest produce they have discovered and are keen to share.

## Target Audience
The target audience will be adults looking to explore the world of cheese and wine.  

They will be curious about new offerings and combinations they have not tried before. They may want advice on what to choose    
and so will need to be able to contact the site owners.

They would be interested in trying the cheese and wine package deals or new suggestions in a newsletter.

The sites audience would also be people looking for gifts or to buy for a party.

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        The main colour I have chosen for the site is wine red, representative of what the site sells.    
        It is a warm decadent colour which tones well with a cream cheese colour also reflecting what the site sells.  
        I have added an additional green colour, advertised on [colorcode.io](https://colorcodes.io/red/wine-red-color-codes/)  as a complimentary colour for the wine red, to add an extra contrasting colour.   
        I have kept the body white with dark writing for good contrast.

        Here is the colour palete generated on [Colormind](http://colormind.io/).
