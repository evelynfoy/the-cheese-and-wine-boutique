## User Experience (UX)

### Purpose

<br>
The purpose of this project is to build an e-commerce site for the fictional cheese and wine business of the "Wilsons".

They import exclusive cheese and wines from all over the world and need an online outlet which displays their wares and provides     
a secure means for customers to buy them.

One of their selling points is that they offer cheese and wine deals of a selected wine and cheese package sold together for a discounted price.    
This is to encourage customers to try new products.

They also want to be able to offer a newsletter telling their customers all about the latest products they have discovered and are keen to share.
  
<br>

### Target Audience
The target audience will be adults looking to explore the world of cheese and wine.  

They will be curious about new offerings and combinations they have not tried before. They may want advice on what to choose    
and so will need to be able to contact the site owners.

They would be interested in trying the cheese and wine package deals or new suggestions in a newsletter.

The siteâ€™s audience would also be people looking for gifts or to buy for a party.

### Design
-   #### Colour Scheme
    The main colour I have chosen for the site is wine red, representative of what the site sells.    
    It is a warm decadent colour which tones well with a cream cheese colour also reflecting what the site sells.  
    I have added an additional green colour, advertised on [colorcode.io](https://colorcodes.io/red/wine-red-color-codes/)  as a complementary colour for the wine red, to add an extra contrasting colour.   
    I have kept the body white with dark writing for good contrast.

    Here is the colour palete generated on [Colormind](http://colormind.io/).
    ![Colour Palete](docs/images/colour-palete.jpg)   

-   #### Typography
    I decided to go for the [Merienda One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merienda+One?query=Merienda+One#about) font from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the logo to give a flourish.     
    According to Google fonts 'It is ideal for headlines which call for height, as its strokes resemble those of a brush and deliver freshness and a dynamic touch in the development of words.'    
    I decided to go with [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=Open+sans#about) font for the rest of the site as it is easy to read and looks good.     
    According to [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) 'It is optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility.    
                 
-   #### Imagery
    I will add icons from [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) where appropriate and photos of the products on sale.
    I will also add an appropriate image to the home page featuring cheese and wine to create interest and ensure the purpose of the site is immediately evident.

### Marketing Strategy and E-commerce Business Model
The Ecommerce Business Model for this project is Business to Consumer as it is for a business targeting ordinary people as customers.

The marking strategy I consider best meets the needs of the Wilsons is as follows:
-   Use of SEO    
    I will employ SEO optimisation techniques and implementations such as semantic markup, keywords and metadata so the site ranks highly with Google.    
    I will also include a site map and robots.txt file to assist the search engines.
-   Content marketing    
    This will be achieved by using keywords in the content of the site and also offering interesting deals which will change constantly, provide interest and promote various products.
-   Email Marketing    
    A form will be provided where visitors can sign up for a newsletter which will contain interesting information about new products and offerings.
-   Social Media Marketing    
    A link to the business' Social Media pages will be included to encourage organic growth.    
    These screenshots were taken from the mock facebook page I created for this project.

### Agile Methodology
[Github issues](https://github.com/evelynfoy/the-cheese-and-wine-boutique/issues) were used to manage the development of this project. I set up a [project backlog](https://github.com/evelynfoy/the-cheese-and-wine-boutique/milestones) milestone containing all the issues at the start.    
Then I set up a [kanban board]( https://github.com/evelynfoy/the-cheese-and-wine-boutique/projects/1) for the project and each week I created a new milestone to use to complete an agile sprint and moved in a number of issues to complete.    
I prioritised the issues according to the MoSCoW technique and labeled them as such. Any issues outstanding at the end of the sprint were moved to the next sprint.    
Here is a screenshot at the end of the first sprint and the beginning of the second.    
<br>

![End Sprint 1](docs/images/end-milestone1.jpg)
![End Sprint 2](docs/images/start-milestone2.jpg)


I used branches to implement all user stories and pull requests to merge the work into the main branch.
Minor tweaks and documentation was done on the main branch. 


## Existing Features
The site consists of a home page featuring a hero image, an inspirational text area, a newsletter signup form and a footer.    
It has a navbar which displays the site name and options to register, login, shop or view the contents of a virtual shopping basket.     
It also includes a search bar and a menu option to filter the products on deals only. This is to encourage users to try new products.   
The shop option displays the products available for purchase at the store and allows the user to add a specified quantity of the item to the virtual shopping basket.    
There is a running total of the basket displayed at all times and the contents can be viewed or adjusted as required.    
From the basket the checkout button provides the means for the user to purchase the items in a secure way using stripe payments.
The user can register and login to view their orders and save their personal information or shop annoynmously.
The site owner can also maintain the product list once logged in. 

### Navigation Bar


![navigation-desktop](docs/images/navigation-desktop.png)
![navigation-phone](docs/images/navigation-phone.png)


The navigation bar is fixed in position at the top of the page.
It includes 
1) The company logo which is also a link to the home page.
2) Links to the other available pages on the site e.g. the shop or products, the basket and the user options which vary on login.
3) A running total of the contents of the customers virtual shopping basket. This doubles as a link to the basket page.
4) A search bar to search through all the products name and description.

![user-options](docs/images/user-options-logged-in.png)
![user-options](docs/images/user-options-logged-out.png)

The user options are represented by a font awesome icon which on click displays a dropdown menu with the following options:-
1) If the user is staff then Project Administration.
2) If user signed in then the user name is displayed and a logout link
3) If no user is logged in then both a register and login option are presented.


The navigation bar is fully responsive and the links are replaced on smaller screens with a hamburger icon.    
The User options, search and basket total move to the next line.

### Search box
-   The search box beside the logo alows searching of the products name and description for a keyword.    
-   This drops to the second line on smaller screens so it is always easily accessible.
-   This example shows the results of the search for the cheese keyword. The wine is shown also because it has the word cheese in its description.

    At this point the user can change the quantity of any item in the basket or remove it entirely.    
    If the quanity is changed then the sub-total is recalculated and a feedback message displayed.    
    The basket total is also displayed with the delivery charge and the grand total.    
    These are re-calulated as item quantities change.    

-   There is a button link back to the shop or product page and a button link to continue to checkout.

## Testing
My testing aproach included:
-   Writing and testing [automated tests](docs/testing/automated-testing.md "Automated Testing") for some functionality as the functionality is written.
-   [User Stories Testing](docs/testing/user-story-testing.md) is performed when a user story is complete and used as a measure that it is ready to be merged into the main application. 
    It involves confirming that the acceptance tests listed in the user story in github were passed.
-   Once all the user stories were done I created a [SPIKE](https://github.com/evelynfoy/the-cheese-and-wine-boutique/issues/42) issue listing all the pages that needed testing and also different versions of pages e.g. Mobile, Desktop
-   I then throughly tested all the pages listed and tried to break the application. All issues resulting from this were added as issues in github.
-   I prioritized them and worked through as many as I had time for.
-   These bugs are listed in the [Manual Tests area](docs/testing/additional-bug-testing.md)

### Code Validation

#### HTML Validator
The W3C Markup Validator was used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-cheese-and-wine-boutique.herokuapp.com%2F)
  - See [Results](docs/images/testing/html-validation-results.png)

#### CSS Validator (Jigsaw)
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-cheese-and-wine-boutique.herokuapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)
  - See [Results](docs/images/testing/css-validation-results.png)

#### Python (Pep8) - 
Results from http://pep8online.com/

| App    | Name                 | image | Result |
|--------|----------------------|-------|--------|
| Basket | contexts.py  | [Results](docs/testing/pep8/basket-contexts.png)     | All right  
| Basket | views.py   |  [Results](docs/testing/pep8/basket-views.png)  | All right  
| Basket | urls.py           |  [Results](docs/testing/pep8/basket-urls.png)         | All right  
| Products | models.py      |  [Results](docs/testing/pep8/products-models.png)    | All right   
| Products | views.py      |  [Results](docs/testing/pep8/products-views.png)    | One line too long   
| Products | forms.py      |  [Results](docs/testing/pep8/products-forms.png)    | No errors  
| Profile | models.py      |  [Results](docs/testing/pep8/profiles-models.png)    | No errors   
| Profile | views.py      |  [Results](docs/testing/pep8/profiles-views.png)    | No errors  
| Profile | forms.py      |  [Results](docs/testing/pep8/profiles-forms.png)    | No errors  
| Checkout | models.py      |  [Results](docs/testing/pep8/checkout-models.png)    | Two lines too long   
| Checkout | views.py      |  [Results](docs/testing/pep8/checkout-views.png)    | No errors  
| Checkout | forms.py      |  [Results](docs/testing/pep8/checkout-forms.png)    | No errors  
| Checkout | signals.py      |  [Results](docs/testing/pep8/checkout-signals.png)    | No errors  

In most cases I split lines that were too long but a few were more awkward to split so I left them alone rather than risking breaking the application.    
This is something I would sort out with more time.

#### Lighthouse 
- Accessibility score 98 
    - search and user profile links do not have discernable name
    - this could probably be resolved using aria-labelling but I did not have time prior to submission
- SEO score 100
- Best Practises score 83 is a bit low as it seems to have some issues with jquery vulnerabilities which I will investigate further.
